# cpsc 39 - Escape Room Final Project

Katelynn Prater - 7/18/25

This repo contains my final project, a program for an escape room that features three puzzles, a droll, ill-mannered narrator, and the creeping feeling that he is stuck with you rather than the other way around. This project is incomplete in the personal sense as I plan many more rooms, but is feature-ready, functional, and complete with room1 and its puzzles as a submission for this final project.

# Additions
This has added:
- Model classes Room, Inventory, Player, RoomState
- Utility classes MusicPlayer, TextMethods, StateTracker
- All the puzzle (3) classes for Room1 and its loop logic
- Folder Reports with report, flowcharts, and pngs of chosen (3) algos

# How to run
- Run Main in EscapeRoomMain.java

# Note
- I have another repo I was simultaneously adding to personally, and since I am new to github, I struggled trying to get both to have the differences I wanted (ie, the personal one w/o headers or report), and this is evidently shown because this correction is after Friday.
- I will note that all items, including the algos, flowcharts, and report, HAVE been added at one point (and eventually removed on accident) to this Repo BEFORE the due date. You can check this!
- I didn't notice this until I checked right now because I was up for >24 hours and quite tired when I turned it in yesterday, so I am very sorry. If you have any questions, Professor, please let me know.
